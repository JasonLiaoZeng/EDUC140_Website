In \u201cMind and Society,\u201d Lev Vygotsky provide three different theories about the relation between the process of learning and nervous system development. Among the three theories, Yvgotsky supports Kofika\u2019s theory, which stated that the process of learning and nervous system developement are correlated. Yvgotsky\u2019s explanation of Kofika\u2019s theory is as follow:",r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__wrapper_indent"},"\u201cThe third theoretical position on the relation between learning and development attempts to overcome the extremes of the other two by simply combining them. A clear example of this approach is Kofika\u2019s theory, in which development is based on two inherently different but related processes, each of which influences the other. On the one hand is maturation, which depends directly on the development of the nervous system; on the other hand is learning, which itself is also a developmental process.\u201d (Yvgotsky)"),"In the quote, Yvgotsky rephased Kofika\u2019s theory and provided an illustration on how he believes that learning and development is related. I, on the other hand, also believe this theory holds because the support for this theory is powerful. Maturation, which is dependent on the development of the nervous system, provides the foundation for the development of higher mental functions. Meanwhile, learning is a developmental process that is influenced by maturation and also has an impact on further development. In other words, the two processes are inherently interconnected and cannot be separated. Overall, what is above provides a fundamental model for multimodal literacy."),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__wrapper"},"By using the model above, learning and development are related, so one can fasten the learning process by stimulating its nervous system development. Therefore, using multiple mode can help stimulate nervous system development, then that supplements the learning process. In Myrrh Domingo\u2019s video \u201cMultimodality in the Classroom,\u201d Domingo mentioned how she uses multimodal text to help students literate. In Domingo\u2019s teaching, she encourages student to first generate ideas with multimodal text such as pictures and audios before trying to put them into a literate form such as a research paper. Domingo also explained in her video that by this method, students tend to generate deeper understanding of a topic. I also agree with that her method helps students in their literate process. Often times, it is hard for students to directly express an idea or feeling with words. But, by jogging the ideas down with multimodal texts, students can easily come back and derive the symbolic meaning behind them, and they will eventually come up with a literate description for each of them. On the other hand, instructions and explanations in plain text might not be the best way to lecture students in some situations. It is often more efficient to both teach and learn using the combination of literacy and multimodal texts such as pictures, videos, activities, etc."),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__wrapper"},"Another reason why multimodal literacy is more effective, under the model representing Kofika\u2019s theory, is that students can utilize what they had developed previously onto learning new topics. In \u201cMultimodality in the Classroom,\u201d Domingo mentioned that it is often easier for students to relate to multimodal texts, the reason behind this is that multimodal text are closer forms to the physical world, which is more familiar. Moreover, one truth is that literacy must be connected to something that exist in the physical world. There is an ancient Chinese dialect \u201c\u8bfb\u4e07\u5377\u4e66\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u884c\u4e07\u91cc\u8def\u3002\u201dIt means that people would gain more knowledge by traveling thousands of miles than reading thousands of books, this is also because that ancient Chinese believed that literacy are developed upon the physical world."),r.a.createElement(h,{className:"btns",buttonStyle:"btn--primary",buttonSize:"btn--large",LinkSet:"/Econ"},"NEXT PAGE ",r.a.createElement("i",{class:"fas fa-arrow-right"}))))};function x(){return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("div",{className:"hero-container"},r.a.createElement("img",{src:k.a,alt:"forest pic"})),r.a.createElement(_,null),r.a.createElement(b,null))}a(28);var I=a(12),S=a.n(I);var C=function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards"},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__container"},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__wrapper"},"Now, there is a story to be told.

But, I could affirm that multimodal literacy fulfilled my entire journey on learning English."),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__wrapper"},"I still remembered there was an English program called ESL for beginners in my elementary school, and I remember that simple vocabulary words were being taught. The instructor provides a picture for each of the vocabulary being taught, and this makes our learning progress much smoother. For example, at the age of 10, I already knew what an apple is, but I did not know how to say it or spell it in English, the instructor\u2019s way of teaching lets me make a connection with what I already knew to the spelling and sound. I proposed that is how vocabulary is being taught in most languages today."),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__wrapper"},"On the other hand, I recall that most other students in the ESL program and I had a hard time learning the twelve months. First of all, no picture is provided for the twelve months, it is very hard to illustrate what month is in picture. Therefore, when we saw the word \u201cJanuary,\u201d \u201cFebruary,\u201d etc., we had no idea what these words corresponded to. Until one of my friends who also speak Chinese told me that those are correspond to each month of the year, I was confused and unmotivated to learn those words. As for now, I think that students will have a easier time to understand the words correspond to months of a year if a calendar is provided on the side when teaching the words."),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"cards__wrapper"},"Another thing I want to mentioned is that language should be reflecting reality, this is also an idea mentioned in \u201cMind and Society,\u201d and the quote is \u201cThis means that written language consists of a system of signs that designate the sounds and words of spoken language, which, in turn, are signs for real entities and relations.\u201d I am in great support for this idea because I realized how lowering the difficulty to literacy can benefit the society. In Chinese and some other languages, the words for months are easy to learn because they are differentiated by numbers, but the word in months in English is following some old traditions. To be specific, words for months in Chinese are \u4e00\u6708\uff0c\u4e8c\u6708\uff0c\u4e09\u6708\uff0cetc, and this literally translate to month one, month two, month three, etc. Meanwhile that the words January, February, March, etc are something that students cannot interpret. This does not mean that Chinese is easier to learn than English. In fact, Chinese is one of the hardest language to learn in my opinion.

Over my literacy journey, I began to realize that the power of words comes from its connections with the physical world. As for instructors who are teaching, the goal is to help student develop a connection between words and reality in their mind, and multimodal texts are proven helpful here. With the combination of texts, pictures, videos, activities, etc, students could learn more effectively. In addition, multimodal texts provide multiple entry points for students of all abilities and learning styles to access and engage with the material. For instance, students who are visual learners can benefit greatly from the use of images and videos, while those who learn through kinesthetic activities can engage with interactive elements in the text. Furthermore, the use of multimodal texts encourages creativity and critical thinking skills as students are required to interpret and analyze information presented in various formats.
